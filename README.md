### About Me
I am a **full stack developer (MERN)** focused on **React**, with **3 years of experience**. Currently, I am working on a **freelance project** that is quite similar to an e-commerce app but with unique ideas.

Feel free to ask me about anything related to the **MERN stack** and related technologies!

### Fun Projects
- **[My Board](https://my-board-two.vercel.app/)**: A drag-and-drop app that also features background-changing options. 
  > *Note: This is not a mobile-friendly app, and there is no backend connected, so data won't be saved.*

### Hobby
I have a passion for **photography**. Check out my work on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@humayra_eva).
